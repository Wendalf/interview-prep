# Cultural Questions

### Introduce yourself

Don’t waste the opportunity by reciting resume, talking about personal background and hobbies in detail.

Start with mentioning milestones in your life. Summarize in few words how you got to the place your are now. While doing that, mention academic background and your projects, certifications, things you attended (workshops, symposiums & conferences).

Basically in a concise, enthusiastic response summarize your big picture fit for the job. Mention proudest achievements and goals.

A proper answer will hit the following:

* Major milestones in your life or past 10+ years of professional career

_What are your primary selling points for this job?_

* Experience
* Training
* Skills

_Why are you interested in this position right now?_

### Why did you become a developer?

Potential Reasons:

* Logical problem solving
* Potential to not be tied to a particular work location
* A creative outlet (designing solutions and solving problems counts as creative)
* Practically limitless potential to improve / continue learning
* Potential to turn my own ideas into reality (maybe even earn some passive income along the way)
* Helping people to solve their problems (not necessarily by doing charitable work)
* The community. The open source movement is absolutely amazing (other industries could learn a lot from this imho)
* The potential to work in almost any industry and with all sorts of people
* Relatively low barrier to entry (easy to get started - not necessarily to get to the stage of being employable)

### Weakenesses

* Discuss Non-Essential Skills
* Mention Skills You Have Improved
* Turn a Negative Into a Positive

Possible answer to consider

* Being organized wasn't my strongest point, but I implemented a time management system that really helped my organization skills.

* I like to make sure that my work is perfect, so I tend to perhaps spend a little too much time checking it. However, I've come to a good balance by setting up a system to ensure everything is done correctly the first time.

* I have always been very passionate about my work, and I sometimes get frustrated when I feel like others aren’t as passionate. I also try to remember that I don’t know what that person may be going through at home or something else that may be affecting them.

### Strengths

* I have an extremely strong work ethic. When I'm working on a project, I don't want just to meet deadlines. Rather, I prefer to complete the project well ahead of schedule.

### How do you juggle competing priorities?

By first assessing what needs to get done and assigning difficulty levels for particular tasks.

If I am dealing with a short deadline and high difficulty project, I group similar items together and get started early on difficult, time consuming tasks first so that if I am approaching close to the deadline I am not scrambing and can address other things as needed.
